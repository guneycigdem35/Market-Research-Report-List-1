<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Liposuction Devices (Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal UAL</li><li>External UAL</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic Liposuction Devices, also known as Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction (UAL) devices, are used for body contouring and fat removal. There are two types of UAL devices: Internal UAL and External UAL. Internal UAL involves inserting a probe directly into the fat tissue to emit ultrasonic waves, which liquefy the fat cells for easy extraction. External UAL, on the other hand, utilizes an external paddles-like device that emits ultrasonic waves externally, breaking down the fat cells. Both types of UAL devices aid in achieving desired body shape by removing excess fat.</p></p>
