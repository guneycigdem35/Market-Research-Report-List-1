<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computerized Microprocessor Controlled Ventilatior Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The computerized microprocessor-controlled ventilator market includes two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used when patients have severe respiratory distress or are unable to breathe on their own. These ventilators require a breathing tube to be inserted into the patient's airway and deliver controlled breaths directly. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilators are used for patients who can breathe on their own but need assistance. These ventilators deliver positive pressure through a mask or nasal prongs, helping to improve gas exchange and ease the workload on the respiratory system.</p></p>
