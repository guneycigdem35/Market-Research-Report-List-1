<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Supplied-air Respirators (SARs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-Pressure Type</li><li>Negative-Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Supplied-air respirators (SARs) are respiratory protection devices used to provide clean air to the wearer in environments with hazardous gases, particles, or chemicals. There are two main types of SARs on the market: positive-pressure and negative-pressure. Positive-pressure SARs continuously supply clean air into the respirator, ensuring a higher level of protection. On the other hand, negative-pressure SARs rely on the wearer's inhalation to draw air through the respirator, making them less efficient. Both types aim to prevent the inhalation of harmful substances and maintain a safe breathing environment for the user.</p></p>
