<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Threshold Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Threshold detectors are devices used to determine if a signal or input crosses a predefined threshold level. There are two main types of threshold detectors: fixed and adjustable. Fixed threshold detectors have a predetermined threshold level that cannot be changed. They are often used in simple applications where the threshold level does not need to be adjusted. On the other hand, adjustable threshold detectors allow users to modify the threshold level according to their specific needs. This flexibility makes them suitable for more complex applications that require changing threshold levels based on varying conditions.</p></p>
