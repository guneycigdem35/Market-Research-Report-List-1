<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waste Compactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Type</li><li>Mobile Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Waste compactors are machines designed to reduce the volume of waste materials, thereby making disposal more efficient. Two common types are stationary and mobile compactors. Stationary compactors are permanently installed on-site and are ideal for high-volume waste producers such as industrial facilities or shopping centers. They compress waste into containers which are then transported for disposal. Mobile compactors, on the other hand, are equipped with wheels and can be easily moved. They are often used in areas with limited space or where waste needs to be compacted at various locations before disposal.</p></p>
