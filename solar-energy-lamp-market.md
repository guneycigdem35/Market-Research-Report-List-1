<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Energy Lamp Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>Grid Connected</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar energy lamps are a type of lighting solution that harnesses the power of the sun to generate electricity. There are two main market types for solar energy lamps- standalone and grid connected. Standalone solar lamps operate independently and do not require a connection to the conventional power grid. They are commonly used in remote areas or during power outages. On the other hand, grid-connected solar lamps are connected to the power grid, allowing excess energy generated during the day to be fed back into the grid and used later when sunlight is insufficient. This type of solar lamp provides a combination of solar and conventional grid power.</p></p>
