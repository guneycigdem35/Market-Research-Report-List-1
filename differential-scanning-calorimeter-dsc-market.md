<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Flux DSC</li><li>Power-compensation DSC</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) is a device used to measure the thermal properties of materials. There are two main types of DSC in the market: Heat Flux DSC and Power-compensation DSC. </p><p>Heat Flux DSC measures the difference in heat flow between a reference material and a sample as they are subjected to controlled temperature changes. It is commonly used for studying the energy transitions and stability of materials.</p><p>Power-compensation DSC, on the other hand, maintains a constant temperature difference between the sample and reference materials by supplying or removing power to compensate for any thermal imbalances. This type of DSC allows for precise heat flow measurements and is often utilized for determining the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of materials.</p></p>
