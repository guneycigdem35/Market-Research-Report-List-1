<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Refrigerant Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld refrigerant leak detector market consists of two types: infrared and semiconductor. Infrared leak detectors use infrared sensors to detect refrigerant leaks by measuring the changes in infrared energy levels emitted by the gases. These detectors are highly accurate and can detect even small leaks. Semiconductor leak detectors, on the other hand, use a heated sensing element that reacts to the presence of refrigerant gases. Although less expensive than infrared detectors, semiconductor detectors are not as sensitive and may not detect smaller leaks.</p></p>
