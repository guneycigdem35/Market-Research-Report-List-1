<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermostatic Radiator Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Operate TRVs</li><li>Electronics Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) are devices used to control the temperature of individual radiators in a heating system. There are two types of market in TRVs: self-operate TRVs and electronics valves. Self-operate TRVs are mechanical valves that adjust the flow of hot water based on the room temperature, allowing users to manually set the desired temperature. Electronics valves, on the other hand, are more advanced and digitally controlled. They use sensors and algorithms to automatically adjust the flow of hot water, providing more precise temperature regulation and often incorporating features such as timers and wireless connectivity.</p></p>
