<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Cooling Fan (above 200mm) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The large cooling fan market, with fans above 200mm, can be divided into two main types: Centrifugal Fans and Axial Fans. Centrifugal fans use rotating impellers to increase the velocity of air, making them ideal for applications that require high-pressure airflow. Axial fans, on the other hand, move air parallel to the fan blade axis, making them better suited for applications that require high airflow rates. Both types of fans are commonly used in industrial cooling systems, HVAC systems, and electronic equipment cooling.</p></p>
