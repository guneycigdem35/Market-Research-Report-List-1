<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer CPU Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The computer CPU cooling fans market comprises two main types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans are widely used in computers due to their compact size and high airflow efficiency. They pull air from the front and exhaust it out the back, keeping the CPU temperature in check. On the other hand, centrifugal fans are larger and often used in high-performance systems. They create directed airflow by spinning the air inwards towards the fan blades, resulting in more concentrated cooling power. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining the optimal operating temperature of computer CPUs.</p></p>
