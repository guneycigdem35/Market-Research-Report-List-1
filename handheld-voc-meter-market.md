<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld VOC Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld VOC meter market consists of two main types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS). PID meters use ultraviolet light to ionize VOCs, allowing them to be detected and measured accurately. They are typically more sensitive and can measure a wider range of compounds. On the other hand, MOS meters use a metal-oxide sensor to detect VOCs based on their chemical reaction with the sensor's surface. While they are generally less expensive, they may have limitations in terms of sensitivity and selectivity compared to PID meters.</p></p>
