<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Paint Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HVLP</li><li>LVLP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric paint gun market can be broadly categorized into two types: HVLP (High Volume Low Pressure) and LVLP (Low Volume Low Pressure). HVLP paint guns use a high volume of air at low pressure to atomize the paint, resulting in less overspray and higher transfer efficiency. These guns are commonly used in automotive and industrial applications for a smooth and even finish. On the other hand, LVLP paint guns operate at a lower volume and pressure, resulting in greater control and precision. They are often preferred for smaller projects or areas that require intricate detailing.</p></p>
