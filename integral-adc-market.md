<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Integral ADC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Charge Balance Analog to Digital Converter</li><li>Dual Slope Analog to Digital Converter</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Charge Balance Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) is a type of market that utilizes the principle of charge balancing to convert analog signals into digital form. It compares the input analog signal against a known reference and generates a digital code representing the signal's magnitude. Dual Slope ADC, on the other hand, employs a dual-slope integration technique to convert analog signals into digital form. It integrates the input signal for a fixed time, then integrates a reference signal for a variable time until the two are balanced, producing a digital output proportional to the input signal.</p></p>
