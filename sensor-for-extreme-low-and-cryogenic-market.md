<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sensor for Extreme Low and Cryogenic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC)</li><li>Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD)</li><li>Thermocouple Sensor</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sensor for extreme low and cryogenic market types include the Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) sensors, Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) sensors, Thermocouple sensors, and others. NTC sensors measure temperature by sensing changes in resistance: as temperature decreases, resistance increases. RTD sensors use the principle that electrical resistance of metals changes linearly with temperature. Thermocouple sensors operate on the basis of the Seebeck effect, where a temperature difference between two dissimilar metals creates a voltage. Other sensors may include silicon diodes or semiconductor-based devices. These sensors enable accurate temperature measurement and control in extreme low and cryogenic conditions.</p></p>
