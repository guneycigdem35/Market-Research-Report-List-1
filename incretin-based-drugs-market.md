<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Incretin-Based Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists</li><li>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Incretin-based drugs are a class of medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. There are two main types of incretin-based drugs on the market: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1 agonists work by mimicking the effects of the natural GLP-1 hormone, which helps to lower blood sugar levels. DPP-4 inhibitors work by blocking the enzyme DPP-4, which in turn increases the levels of GLP-1 in the body, leading to improved blood sugar control.</p></p>
