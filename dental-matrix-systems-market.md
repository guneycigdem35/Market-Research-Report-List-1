<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Matrix Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circumferential Matrix System</li><li>Sectional Matrix System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental matrix systems are used in dentistry for filling cavities and restoring teeth. There are two main types of dental matrix systems: circumferential and sectional. The circumferential matrix system involves placing a band around the entire tooth, creating a wall to hold the filling material in place. In contrast, the sectional matrix system uses smaller, individual matrices to create separate compartments for each tooth surface being filled. Both systems aim to provide proper support and facilitate the accurate placement of dental fillings.</p></p>
