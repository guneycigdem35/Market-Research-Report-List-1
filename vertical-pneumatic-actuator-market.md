<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Pneumatic Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-acting Actuators</li><li>Double-acting Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vertical pneumatic actuator market is divided into two types: single-acting actuators and double-acting actuators. Single-acting actuators operate when pressure is applied to extend the actuator rod, and a spring is used to retract it when pressure is released. They are commonly used when a force is only required in one direction. Double-acting actuators, on the other hand, use air pressure to extend and retract the actuator rod. They are versatile and suitable for applications requiring force in both directions.</p></p>
