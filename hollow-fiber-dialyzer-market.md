<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Fiber Dialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow fiber dialyzer market includes two types of membranes: low flux and high flux. Low flux membrane is a type of dialyzer used for standard dialysis. It allows small molecules like waste products to pass through but retains large molecules like proteins. On the other hand, high flux membrane is designed to remove larger molecules more efficiently. It has larger pores that enable the passage of both small and large molecules, providing better clearance. These membranes cater to different dialysis needs and play a crucial role in the treatment of various kidney diseases.</p></p>
