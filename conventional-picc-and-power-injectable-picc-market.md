<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional PICC and Power-Injectable PICC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional PICC</li><li>Power-Injectable PICC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conventional PICC refers to peripherally inserted central catheters that are not designed for power injection of contrast media. These catheters are used for administration of medications, fluids, and blood products into larger veins. On the other hand, power-injectable PICC can withstand high-pressure injection of contrast agents for diagnostic imaging purposes, making them suitable for contrast-enhanced CT scans and other procedures. Power-injectable PICC lines have higher flow rates, larger lumens, and specialized materials to prevent rupture during injection, compared to conventional PICC lines.</p></p>
